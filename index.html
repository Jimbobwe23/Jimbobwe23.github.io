        <p> Fun Facts about me. One is, I love food. Who doesn't love food, am I right? I love exploring the endless range of food for example from different cultures and flavors. </p>

          <p> Ramen is one of my favorite type of dish/food that I can never get tired of. I prefer my Ramen to be really spicy, and I'm a really huge carnivore, I love any type of meat, so I'd prefer to have more meat on my Ramen than vegetables.

<h2> <i>I am</i> </h2>
<p>I am nice and mean. <br> I wonder about V'day and Prom. <br> I hear annoyance. <br> I see the world. <br> I want something. <br> I am me. </p>
<p>I pretend to be shaggy. <br> I feel nothing <br>I touch soft. <br> I worry for nothing. <br> I cry to food <br> I am me.</p> <p> <br> I "understand" the earth is "flat". <br> I say oof. <br> I dream of dreams. <br> I try to breath. <br> I hope to sleep <br> I am me. </p>
